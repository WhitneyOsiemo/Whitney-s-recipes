                 <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                 <li>15 ounces (425g) ricotta cheese</li>
                 <li>1/2 cup (50g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                 <li>1 egg</li>
                 <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (optional)</li>
                 <li>2 cups (200g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
           </ul>
     <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>         
                <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until the onion is translucent and the beef is fully cooked.</li>
                <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper to the skillet. Stir well to combine. Simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, egg, and chopped parsley (if using). Mix well.</li>                  To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top. Spread about half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of meat sauce. Sprinkle with shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers, ending with a final layer of meat sauce and mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
                <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and golden.</li>
                <li> Remove from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the lasagna to set</li>
